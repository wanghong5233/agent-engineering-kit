## What We Reused

- Prompt changes and LLM behavior must be versioned, evaluated, and gated.
- Golden datasets are the minimum unit of quality regression testing.
- Production prompts/features require rollback and monitoring.

## What We Changed

- Expanded from prompt governance to full Agent observability:
  route decisions, retrieval plans, tool calls, provider failures, async jobs, UI states.
- Added project-derived contracts: `accepted/running/failed/timed_out`, `index_mode`, `route_reason`, `policy_version`.
- Kept prompt registry details out of the body; they can become a separate `prompt-governance` skill later if needed.

## Why Not Copy Verbatim

Prompt governance is one slice of production Agent quality. This skill broadens the contract to explain why a request behaved the way it did across RAG, tools, model providers, persistence, and frontend state.
